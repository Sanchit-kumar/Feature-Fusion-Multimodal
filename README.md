# Feature-Fusion-Multimodal
I am currently working on it and I can only share a few files of the early development phase in this repository. If you  need further help, you can connect me at sanchit.dabgotra@gmail.com

The shared code is the implementation of the multi-modal, multi-level and multi-scale based datafusion to achieve the state of the art  binary image segmentation results using deep learning.
