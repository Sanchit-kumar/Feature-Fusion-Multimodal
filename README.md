# Feature-Fusion-Multimodal
For Salient objects in a complex environment condition is very challenging, especially when 24 x 7 hour of surveillance is required.  We are using RGB-T images to produce the very best results.
 
The shared code is the implementation of the multi-modal, multi-level and multi-scale based datafusion to achieve the state of the art  binary image segmentation results using deep learning considering complex environmental conditions.
